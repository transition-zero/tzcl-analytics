# TransitionZero · Claude Analytics

A private dashboard of Claude usage across the organisation, hosted on GitHub Pages
at `https://transition-zero.github.io/tzcl-analytics/`.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The dashboard. Static, never changes month to month. |
| `data.enc` | All the figures, encrypted. Useless without the password. |
| `harvest.js` | Collects next month's figures from claude.ai. |

## Why the data is encrypted

This repository is public, because GitHub Pages on a free account cannot publish
from a private repository. The dashboard contains named staff usage and spend, so
the data file is encrypted before it is ever committed.

`data.enc` contains nothing but a salt, an IV and ciphertext. Anyone who downloads
it sees noise. The dashboard asks for a password, derives a key from it in the
browser (PBKDF2-SHA256, 250,000 iterations) and decrypts with AES-256-GCM. The
password is never transmitted and is not stored anywhere.

## Refreshing it each month

1. Sign in to claude.ai as an org admin and open **Analytics → Overview**.
   Let the page finish loading and scroll to the bottom so every panel has rendered.
2. Open the browser console and paste in the contents of `harvest.js`.
   It returns a JSON object containing that month's figures. Everything is fetched;
   nothing is typed in by hand.
3. Hand that JSON to Claude and ask it to refresh the dashboard. It rebuilds
   `data.enc` and pushes it here.
4. GitHub Pages rebuilds within a couple of minutes. The URL does not change,
   so there is nothing to send anyone.

## Where the numbers come from

Spend figures come from the internal analytics JSON API. The remaining panels are
read from the rendered analytics pages, because the full analytics API is only
available on Enterprise plans.

Two limitations worth knowing:

- **Per-engineer Claude Code detail is unavailable** until the Claude Code GitHub
  app is confirmed on the TransitionZero repositories. Until then the per-user PR
  and lines-of-code panels show "Data processing".
- **The time-saved figure is Anthropic's own model**, driven mostly by an
  assumption of 150 minutes saved per pull request. Treat it as an order of
  magnitude rather than a measurement.

## Two different time windows, on purpose

The dashboard reports on two windows and never mixes them:

- **Monthly adoption** and **Cost** are calendar months (March 2026 onward). Per-user
  chat, Cowork and Claude Code figures exist as a real monthly series, so these
  restate cleanly for any month you pick.
- **Usage detail** is a rolling 30-day snapshot, labelled as such on the page.

That split is forced by the source, not chosen. The headline statistics and member
tables on `claude.ai/analytics` are hard-wired to a rolling 30 days: the 1W/1M/3M/1Y
control only redraws the chart beneath them. Clicking 1Y was tested on 11 Aug 2026 and
every headline figure and table stayed identical.

So there is no way to restate skills, connectors, stickiness, actions-per-prompt or
time-saved for a past month. **Do not back-fill them.** The agreed approach is to
capture the snapshot once a month from now on and build the history forward — a real
time series appears after three or four monthly captures.

The one exception found so far is Projects: the "See all" dialog exposes the full list
with a created date per project, so history there is recoverable and is already in the
data (47 projects back to March).

### The archive

`history/` holds one JSON file per capture, and every capture ever taken is embedded in
`data.enc` and shown in the **Snapshot history** panel. `capture.py` writes a new one.

Three rules, and they matter more than the code:

1. **Captures are immutable.** `capture.py` refuses to overwrite one. If a figure was
   wrong on the day, it was still what the product reported on the day — record the
   correction separately rather than rewriting history.
2. **Never invent a missed month.** A gap in the table is honest. A back-filled column
   is a lie that looks like data.
3. **Every value is read from the product**, never calculated, projected or estimated.

Per-user spend is the urgent one: `claude.ai/admin-settings/usage` resets each period,
so if a month is not captured before the reset, the per-person split is gone permanently
and only the organisation total survives.

## Two kinds of project — only one is counted

Claude has two different things called projects, and the analytics only see one:

- **Chat projects** live in the cloud, can be set public or private, and are what the
  Projects panel counts (47 of them, back to March).
- **Cowork projects** live locally on someone's desktop, do not sync to the cloud, and
  **cannot be shared at all** — Anthropic's documentation states that Cowork projects do
  not support project sharing on Team and Enterprise plans. They appear nowhere in the
  organisation analytics; `claude.ai/analytics/cowork` has no projects section, only
  sessions, users and file categories.

So the real number of projects at TransitionZero is higher than 47 and cannot be
measured. The dashboard says so on the panel.

Also note that "shared" in the Projects panel means *more than one person has used it*,
which is not the same as the public/private visibility setting. A project set to public
that nobody else has opened still shows one user.

## Per-user spend

Per-user spend comes from `claude.ai/admin-settings/usage` → "Spend limits by user",
which holds **actual billed amounts in GBP for the current period only** and resets
monthly. The analytics API's per-user USD figure is a model, not a bill — it was 3x
below the org-level figure for June — and is deliberately not shown anywhere in the
dashboard. If per-user spend history matters, it has to be captured monthly before the
period rolls over.
